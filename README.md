What challenges did you encounter when configuring environment variables in the GitHub Actions workflow?
  * Not much of a challenage as instructions are clear, only challenage was figure out where to add env section initially but just followed instructions with no issue

How does deploying microservices on Azure Web App Service differ from running them locally?
  * Deploying on Web App Service was quick and easy, product serive was the easiest, and adding enviroment vvariables to other were every simple./

Why is it important to use environment variables for configurations in a cloud environment?
  * In lab2, locally there was a .env file to edit/add to the vm. however best practice is to have it in a gitignore. to not share publicly.
